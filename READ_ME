The Turtlebot3 has been simulated using ROS and Gazeobo tools. 

In order to do this you need to have ros, turtle bot packages and catkin_make installed.

I have included the turtle bot packages in the submission in case it is needed. 

THE PACKAGE FOR CODE SUBMISSION IS THE "TURTLE_LASER" folder.

The code for obstacle avoidance is this path: turtle_laser/src/motion4.py


how to RUN:

open the terminal and run:

            roslaunch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_stage_4.launch 

for teleoping the turtlebot3 :

            roslaunch turtlebot3_teleop turtlebot3_teleop_key.launch

for obstacle avaoidance behaviour :

            rosrun turtle_laser motion4.py
